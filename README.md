Project Title: ArAduino LED Controller

Overview:
This Arduino LED Controller project allows you to control a series of LED lights connected to an Arduino microcontroller. By pressing a designated button, the program initiates dynamic lighting effects, including flashing lights and randomized sequences. This README provides an overview of the project's functionality and instructions on how to set up and use the code effectively.

Functionality:
The main functionality of this project includes:

Flashing LED lights in a predefined sequence.
Randomly shuffling the order of LED activation.
Activating LED lights for a specified duration, with randomized delays between activations.
Resetting the program state after each sequence.
Usage:
To use this code with your Arduino setup, follow these steps:

Connect the LED lights to the Arduino microcontroller according to the specified pin configuration.
Upload the provided code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
Once uploaded, power on the Arduino and press the designated button to initiate the LED lighting sequences.

Dependencies:
This project requires the Arduino IDE for code compilation and uploading to the Arduino board. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary hardware components, including LEDs, resistors, and a pushbutton, as specified in the code.
